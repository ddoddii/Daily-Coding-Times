                <p>Foundational knowledge of computer science is a <strong>MUST</strong> if you are preparing to be a professional software engineer.

Most interesting course was <a href="https://github.com/ddoddii/Multicore-GPU-Programming">Multicore GPU Programming</a>, where I learned about parallel programming with c++ and used Nvidia CUDA to <a href="https://github.com/ddoddii/Multicore-GPU-Programming/tree/main/HW6">build VGG-16 from scratch</a>. The assignments were painful, but I gained a lot from them. </p>
                <p>You can click on each courses to see the details. I organized them in a neat way, so you can take a look, and hopefully it helps on your software engineering journey!</p>

            <h4>Fun Fact</h4>
            <p>My all-time favorite food is pork cutlet. I've searched all nights to find the best pork-cutlet restaurants in Seoul. After munching my way through countless crispy delights, I’ve crowned <a href="https://map.naver.com/p/entry/place/1531767806?c=15.00,0,0,0,dh"><em>Shiki-Katsu</em></a> as the reigning champion. Seriously, if pork cutlets were an Olympic sport, Shiki-Katsu would take the gold! If you know any hidden pork-cutlet gems, please, spill the beans (or the sauce)!</p>
            <p>When I’m not programming, you’ll find me lost in the pages of a science fiction novel. My top pick? Andy Weir's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary"> <em>『Project Hail Mary』</em></a>. It's got everything: space, humor, and a friendly alien neighbor. If you’ve got any sci-fi recommendations that will make me feel like travelling thorugh the galaxy, let me know!</p>

                <div class="multi-column-3">
                    <p>Programming is somewhat similar to architecture, except my buildings are made of code and won't collapse (hopefully). I can build products just as I imagine them, but with fewer hard hats and safety inspections. I started my journey with AI and data science. But nowadays, my heart beats for backend engineering, where I ensure that everything runs smoothly behind the scenes.</p>
                    <p>Now, my mission is to deliver real-life products safely to real-life users without any 'Oops, something went wrong' moments. I'm particularly fascinated by databases and serving machine learning models, ensuring they work seamlessly and efficiently. My commitment to hard work drives me to constantly improve and take on new challenges. Ultimately, my dream goal is to become a professional who can solve business problems with code, and enlighten the world with my imagination.</p>
